## HELPERS

#### Commitlint

Particular ules, using concepts of gitmoji (changed by me)

- **example:** ✨ [dashboard]: markdown component

#### Vite

I choose to use the new Tooling ViteJs and the steps to start the applications is very similar to CRA

1. Install packages -> `npm install` || `yarn`
2. Run the server -> `npm run start` || `yarn start`

#### React Testing Library

Unfortunately (and I didn't know that) Vite still doesn't have full support for React Testing library, which uses another bundler than rollup (bundler used in Vite)
